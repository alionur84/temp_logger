A temperature, humidity and luminous intensity logger with Arduino.  

It uses and arduino uno and a SD card module to log the outside temperature, humidity and luminous intensity values in every 5 minutes.  

A Seven Segment TM1637 is used as digital display.  
Real time clock is a DS3231 module and DHT11 is the temperature and humidity sensor. For the luminous intensity I used a temt6000.  

The project also involves a push button to switch the displayed value between temperature, humidity and lux.
